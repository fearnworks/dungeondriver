## Architecture
This project is split into two main components :
- DungeonDriver : A interface containing table top RPG logic and interfaces with the AI Driver inference server
- AI Driver : A FastAPI inference server that handles all of the details of running inference on the models.

These items are currently set up to run locally through docker-compose but can be easily split into separate containers for deployment.

AI Driver Technologies :
- Server/API : FastAPI w/gunicorn
- Database: Sqlite/SQLAlchemy/Alembic
- Agents : Langchain/Langsmith
- Vectorstores : FAISS, Pinecone
- CPU Inference : Ctransformers (GGML)

DungeonDriver Technologies :
- UI : Gradio

## üöÄ Getting Started
DungeonDriver and its companion inference server AI Driver are meant to be run inside of container for easy deployment in any environment. Docker and Docker Compose must be installed in your environment. Cuda drivers are required for GPU support. Drivers should be capable of running cuda 12.x

### Docker
